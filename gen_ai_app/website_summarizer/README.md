git clone <repository-url>
cd gen_ai_app/website_summarizer
```

### 2. Create the environment variable file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your OpenAI API key
```

### 3. Build the Docker image
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 4. Start the application

## Security Notes for Production

- **Never commit real API keys or DB credentials to a public repository.**
    - Store production secrets only in `.env` (not committed), and keep only dummy values in `.env.example`.
- **Always disable debug mode (`debug=True`) in production.**
- **Error handling**
    - Do not return detailed error messages or stack traces to users.
    - Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information.
- **Authentication/Authorization and CSRF protection**
    - This app does not implement authentication or CSRF protection by default. If you deploy as a public service, implement authentication (e.g., Flask-Login) and CSRF protection.
- **SQL Injection**
    - The app uses SQLAlchemy ORM, so direct SQL injection risk is low. For future features, always use ORM for DB access.
- **Dependency management**
    - Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security advisories.

### Summary
This is a Flask-based AI chat and website summarization app using the OpenAI ChatGPT API. For production, never commit real API keys or DB credentials, always disable debug mode, and implement authentication/CSRF protection if you deploy as a public service.
